# rental-bicycle-database
Designed an E/R model for a bicycle rental scheme, developed the database and wrote some queries for generating reports and graphs using Python and PostgreSQL.

The Python script utilizes SQL through the psycopg2 library to interact with a PostgreSQL database. It establishes a connection, creates a database, defines tables (customers, prices, and stations), and inserts data. The code also incorporates SQL queries for managing a bike-sharing system. Additionally, it employs matplotlib for data visualization in generating reports.
